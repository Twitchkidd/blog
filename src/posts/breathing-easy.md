# Breathing Easy

## Intro

Two weeks ago I went in to my Primary Care Physician for back pain, had a mental breakdown in their office, and life has since taken a 180\* turn for the better. This is my experience with getting help for ADHD and Anxiety.

## Attention Deficit Disorder

This has a few parts, so we've got to break it down, and let's handle the "Attention Deficit" first.

What do you think of when you think of ADHD? I might be showing my ignorant true colors, but I think of a kid who just _can't stop_ running around screaming. Total brat.

Then if asked to picture _adult_ ADHD, at first you might draw a complete blank, no such thing. Maybe a faint bell rings for 'adult ADD,' and you might think fo maybe a fast food worker with a goldfishes attention span, and forgive me for picturing this person as a dimwit. Adult ADHD, though? What, like that guy, but really good at the cleaning? Or maybe you picture more of a manic pixie type, like Alex the Frenchman. Very chic. Very mysterious. Where do they get their inspiration? Their pep?

## Extended Intro

... And anxiety? Like being nervous about things?

Just relax.

Lighten up a little.

I saw someone on Twitter descibe ADD not as a _lack_ of focus, rather a lack of ability to be able to _control_ one's focus, and that helped it click for me. I can focus intently, I pride myself on attention to detail, I _couldn't_ have ADD, except really I knew since my sister showed me some home video she'd dug up. I was running back and forth from the kitchen to the living room shouting, for whatever reason, "One-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight-nine-ten-eleven!" Our mother is at the kitchen table. She looks _very_ tired.

What's it like to not have control of your focus, though, like what does that even _mean?_ The _results_ of not having control of your focus, that's something I think everyone is a little familiar with. Unfinished side projects, untidiness, missing a step in some process, fogetting some small to-do, moving from room to room and having to trace the string back to try and find what you meant to be doing ... but to understand the visceral _experience_ of it, here's the moment receently that helped me understand it by experiencing its absence.

I took Dawa to the trail, and we'd managed to cover a good distance, and I'd done enough work putting my body together that we were rocking and rolling, and I wasn't in pain, and just for a minute I was able to _think._ I realized I'd spent _years_ so stressed I couldn't properly think, like, hold an internal monologue and not have your entire experience being dominated by your senses and stimuli. The experience of just _being_ your vision, your whole consciousness in the heat behind your eyes, and that static-y pulsing running between your ears and over the top of your skill, running on autopilot at a hundred-and-fifty miles-an-hour, that's been about all I can manage for a while now; it was a real shock being hit with that moment of calm, mentally being able to take a step back, and observe the self, thoughhts forming completely and whole instead of staggered and piecemeal.

## Anxiety

To talk about the hyperactivity, first let's understand the anxiety aspect, specifically how it's _not_ just "all in your hea" like that's something you can just laugh off, or, as a **macho man,** if you can't deal with it by sucking it up, what does that mean, does your willy just fall off? Etc.

Truth is, anxiety is what _happens_ when you suck it up, you suck up all that stress and fear and hurt into your body, because that's how you had to handle it, until your body is wracked with pain and your mind tortured with horrors real and imagined, and at some point you can suck it up no more, and I hope you choose to get help because, for me, relief, total relief, a great unshouldering, took fifteen minutes to kick in, and was like someone flipped a light switch.

I went in hoping to get my back imaged, but I was at the breaking point. I'd wake up at four in the morning and fly around at 110% and train and handle the dog and do busy work until I crashed ... movement helped with thhe pain, but I'd train myself into injury. I felt totally helpless to plan my life, or my day. The Planning Department was just totally unavailable, and I couldn't sit anyway, which makes breaking into software engineering difficult. I've had to downgrade from a 2020 MacBook Pro to a Raspberry Pi, and amoung everything else going on, the Nazis are at the dog park, and I almost died on my bike ... from not focusing on the road.

So I totally broke down, like one level above 'puddle on the floor,' and the nurse understood what I was saying, I was a little frazzled by the time the docttor came in, though. At the end of the visit, they recommended I make an appointment to see a psychiatrist, quickly, and ordered x-rays and extra-strength ibuprofin, tilted their head to the side and said, "... I can tell you're uncomfortable." [Arrow pointing that to after 'end of the visit']

In the span of a week, now, I've gone from being in total crisis to getting medicine that works, imaging of my back, therapy (counceling,) and an appointment for physical therapy for muscle stiffness and _arthritis_ of all things. I would not have believed it if you'd told me.

This medicine is incredible. It's not without drawbackks. At least at first here, it comes with some nausea and GI distress, headache, and shortness of breath, but I'll endure that for the rest of my life if I need to. The knob that's been stuck at 110% for so long, I can still turn it up when I need to, but it's under my [underlined]control now. I still have worries, and fears, but they aren't running through my head on repeat, at 2X speed, at maximum volume. Bad things can happen and it doesn't ruin my day. I can think. I can breathe easy.

Turns out I had to remember _how._ I realized I'd been stress-breathing with my neck and chest muscles for so long, I had to retrain myself to breathe with my diaphragm. Everything feels new. What I'd done so quickly and, except for the panicked shaking, efficiently, now I was doing it with a totally different nervous system, the parasympathetic one being _chilled out._ I'm realizing every passing day it's going to be work starting from the beginning again, and the dreams of instantly having my shit together were really pretty heady, but now there's _hope._ I can't wait to see what I can make it, here, and I hope I helped clear up any misconception, or broaden understanding, or encourage you to get help if you need it, or just I hope you got to know me a little better.

To the future!
